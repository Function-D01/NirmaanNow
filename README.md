# NirmaanNow - Construction Materials Landing Page

This repository contains the source code for a clean, modern, and fully responsive landing page for "NirmaanNow," a fictional construction materials and logistics company.

The project is built from scratch using **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with a strong focus on mobile-first design, modern CSS practices, and accessibility.

## 🚀 Features

    * Toggling `aria-expanded` attributes for screen readers.
    * Closing the menu when a link is clicked.
    * Closing the menu by clicking outside of it.
    * Closing the menu by pressing the `Escape` key.
* **Interactive UI:** Smooth hover animations on cards and buttons, and a subtle pulsing gradient on the hero section.
* **Zero Dependencies:** Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks or external libraries are required (aside from Google Fonts and Material Icons).
* **Clean & Semantic HTML:** Well-structured HTML5 with clear sections like Hero, Services, About, and Contact.
